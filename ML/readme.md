# ML Directory Overview

This directory contains various machine learning models and experiments as Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts. Here's a breakdown of each subdirectory and its contents:

## BGD (Batch Gradient Descent)
- `p2.ipynb`: Implements a batch gradient descent algorithm, likely for a regression problem.
- `prueba.ipynb`: A test notebook for experimenting with gradient descent techniques.

## SVM (Support Vector Machines)
- `SVM.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook detailing the implementation and testing of a Support Vector Machine model.

## Bayes
- `bayes.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating Bayesian methods, possibly for classification or regression.

## KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- `knn.ipynb`: Illustrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, commonly used in classification problems.

## p1
- `6.py`: Python script associated with a PDF document (possibly a report or assignment).
- `7.py`: Another Python script linked with a corresponding PDF.
- `RL.py`: Python script for implementing Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
- `paleteria.csv`: Data file used in the Python scripts.

## p2
- `p2.py`: Python script for machine learning model validation methods.
- `metodosDeValidacion.csv`: Dataset used in `p2.py` for method validation.

## p3
- `p3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploring advanced machine learning models.
- `p3.py`: Accompanying Python script for `p3.ipynb`.
- `mono.csv`, `multi.csv`, `ols.csv`: Datasets used within this project.

## p4
- `p4.ipynb`, `p4_2.ipynb`: Series of notebooks focusing on Bayesian methods with practical examples.
- `emails.csv`, `iris.csv`: Datasets utilized in Bayesian experiments.

## p5
- `p5.ipynb`: Notebook detailing machine learning techniques for medical data analysis.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset used in `p5.ipynb` concerning heart disease.

This README is designed to help navigate and understand the experiments and implementations within the ML directory.
